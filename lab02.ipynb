    "\n",
    "All artificial intelligence systems have the potential to fail and in some domains\n",
    "(like health) failures can have grave consequences.  When we work in these domains,\n",
    "it's important for us to understand our algorithmic errors and their potential risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!--\n",
    "In labs 2, 5 and 7, we'll loosely be following the autiding procedure suggested by [Lui et. al](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(22)00003-6/fulltext) in order to build and analyze a decision making system that operates in a high risk domain.\n",
    "-->\n",
    "\n",
    "In labs 2, 5 and 7, we will use data from The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey [NHANES](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm) in the United States.\n",
    "This survey runs annually to assess people's health and nutritional status, and it combines data from interviews and physical examinations. We will be exploring a\n",
    "handful of attributes from the 2014 instance of this survey and their ability to predict heart disease.\n",
    "Making decisions using health data is particularly high risk, so we will use this opportunity to discuss\n",
    "how to assess our model prior to using it.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!--\n",
    "We will then do some testing according to\n",
    "the [auditing recipe](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(22)00003-6/fulltext#seccestitle40) presented by Liu.\n",
    "-->\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will explore the features in this data set, use `sklearn` to fit a\n",
    "decision tree to our data, and do some work to select hyperparamters that maximize\n",
    "accuracy (or minimize the number of our classification mistakes). In future labs, we\n",
    "will be exploring our mistakes, relating them to important subgroups, and reflecting\n",
    "on our model's robustness. We will also consider how assessments of risk associated\n",
    "with our errors should or could inform our decision making criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Perform an exploratory analysis to understand the features that we use to make predictions.\n",
    "2. Transform features into formats amenable to machine learning (i.e. using one-hot embeddings).\n",
    "3. Use `sklearn` to fit a decision tree to our data and determine its training/validation/test accuracy. \n",
    "4. Visualize, understand and interpret a decision tree diagram.\n",
    "5. Explain how various hyperparameter choices may cause our decision tree to underfit or overfit data.\n",
    "6. Perform hyperparameter tuning to search for the optimal hyperparameters of a decision tree. \n",

In lecture, and earlier in this lab, we used `entropy` as the criterion. Another criterion that Sklearn supports is `gini` (Gini impurity index). You don't need to know the implementation details behind this as we'll rely on Sklearn to compute it. However, if you are interested in learning more about this alternative impurity index, we encourage you to [read more about it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient).\n",
